    "\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "An exception in python is the abrupt termination of the program while it is being executed. It may happen because of various reasons like dividing by zero, calling out of bound memory or trying to use a variable which has not been defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas syntax errors arises before the execution of the program begins. They arises during the compliation phase of the program and occurs because of the wrong syntax of code written by the programmer like missing keyword, spelling a keyword wrong etc."
